<h1>Fried Eggs</h1>
<img src="images/2.jpeg" alt="Eggs">
<p class="description">Fried eggs are a delicious and simple breakfast dish that can be enjoyed any time of day. To make fried eggs, crack a fresh egg into a hot, greased skillet and cook until the white is set but the yolk is still runny. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste and serve hot, either on their own or with toast, bacon, or other breakfast favorites.

    The beauty of fried eggs lies in their versatility - they can be cooked to your preferred level of doneness, from sunny-side up with a completely runny yolk to over easy with a slightly set yolk. The crispy edges of the fried egg add a satisfying contrast to the soft, creamy yolk, creating a perfect balance of textures. Whether enjoyed as a standalone dish or incorporated into a breakfast sandwich or salad, fried eggs are a classic and comforting breakfast option that never disappoints.
